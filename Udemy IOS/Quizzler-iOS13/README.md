#  Clone coding from Udemy Angela's IOS

First time to used MVC pattern with IOS application developement.
Through Angela's challenges, It made me help to learn what is mutating func, how to use Timer Class and @objc.
the progressbar challenge took a lot of time. but it was very interest and cool!

When you click the wrong answer, the button shows up with red color for a while and move to next Question.
but if you click the right one, the button's color will be changed by green, and the score would be added!
when you reach to the end, the score, progressbar and the questions would be reset to the first one.

Doing challenge from Angela's (or whoever) always help me to learn by myself and it lasts more strong in your memory.
Don't give up! if it takes a long time, it's fine:)
