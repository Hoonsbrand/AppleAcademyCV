#  Clone code from Udemy Angela's IOS

Use MVC pattern.
The Key Point of this lesson was knowing where your stories at and the answers follow by sotries.


My codes had some issues when I tried to solve nextStory Challenge.
You need to know what your function depends on.
And compare what actually happening in your code with the expectations of the codes.
check out my note for more details! (sorry, the note is for korean only.)

There was two choices when i start this clone project.
one of them was without layout practice which you don't have to set your UI from the first time. but I needed to practice the layout!
I still not so good at them but it was worth.
So even it takes more time and the way you study looked not straight, Just do it if you are not so sure about it! This is the actual shortcut to learning.
because you will have to do them later anyways since you don't know it enough.
