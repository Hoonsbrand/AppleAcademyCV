Welcome to Hoonaland!
I've had a hard time to studying programming, I started to code and the reason was just I couldn't find what I love as a job.
I started programming with python and Unity game projects. About the Unity projects, I went to class during my military services period.
It was a good first step to learning the programming. I could see what's going on with my character whenever I put an object or something like that.
But I've always felt like something is wrong with this. It was like I'm just doing what my teacher told me to do. 
So I made a study group with one of my bestfriends and we started study a web programming. 
Very first time in my life ever, I studied programming as a team even it was just two of us.
We made a plan together and compare each's codes, trying to solve many errors together whenever one of us' code has an issue.
And as he trying to get a job as programmar I needed to make a new plan since I'm still in my university as Junior.
As you can see, I love experience many things but I still want to have a thing I can say I'm specialized at something. 
And when i met IOS Developement, I felt something different. Still complicated as any other programmming but I smile with making an app. I go to coworking office 
more than 6 days a week and take Udemy Angela's IOS lecture, trying to customize it and make my own project with mixed things what I've learned!
Also Language is really really important, I study with a book called "Swift 5" by Yagom.

In my whole life, I literally can say this one would change my life. 
I often disappointed to myself or blamed myself because compare my programming skills and knowledge with the period I've studied for programming when I was so passive.
But now, even I don't really remember the things what I've done with programming in the past, I don't think it was a waste.
They made me meet IOS programming and Swift.

Please look forward my journey and I will pay back to people who has same problems that I had.
Even though I couldn't be a programming tutor, I could share your worries together and look for the way together!
